MYSQL experiment notes;

> Set up docker instance with a mysql server running.
> the docker instance could be shared with other instances, make the mysql server running in background.
> mysql -u [username] -p [dbname] -e [query] > [somefilename] this is how you get the data to a file

 docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -e MYSQL_USER=dinda  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=dinda  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=dinda -d java-judge:1.0.0

 docker exec -it some-mysql bash

 mysql -u dinda -p dinda -e select * from employee;  > sometext.txt
mysql -u dinda -pdinda dinda -s -e "select * from employe;" >> out.txt  2>err.txt ; // with out.txt and err.txt; // added -s to remove the header  // -t to show in table format

export MYSQL_PWD=dinda ;mysql -u dinda  dinda -s -e "select * from employe;" >> out.txt  2>err.txt ; // solves the mysql warning on the err file , about the password being passed from comand line


// Test cases ;

A multiline and the error text should honor the multiline;

export MYSQL_PWD=dinda ;mysql -u dinda  dinda -s -e "select
* from *
employe;" >> out.txt  2>err.txt

I Finally decided to include the mysql 8 version
